Name:
  Zeekthefreek
Purpose:
  To learn how to code and improve myself. Not only a challenge, but a life skill.
  
I like music. I keep an old school collection of tapes, vinyls, and cd's. I also keep up with a lot of current things too.
Chances are, I've heard it or something like it, if you know what I'm saying.
